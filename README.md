# Tic-tac-toe
Creating a web application for the Tic-Tac-Toe game was an enjoyable experience. I had a blast learning how games work by applying JavaScript, and I also got to express my creativity by giving the game a visually appealing design using CSS. Thank you for the opportunity - I not only learned a lot but also had a great time doing it!
